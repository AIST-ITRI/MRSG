To run the example, follow these steps:

1) Make sure you have installed SimGrid (3.6.2 recommended).
   (http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/)

2) Inside MRSG's root and examples directories, edit the Makefiles and change
   the INSTALL_PATH variable to match your SimGrid installation path
   (e.g. /usr).

3) Compile MRSG with 'make' in the command line, and then do the same for the
   example.

4) Execute the example (./hello.bin).
